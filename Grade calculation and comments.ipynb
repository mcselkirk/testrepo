There's a chance that one of your treatment groups just happens to be smarter or better prepared for the test than another group, and that could skew your results. This could be a confounding variable. I'm not sure how you can control for this - maybe use SAT/ACT score as a measure of academic ability and then try to make sure that your treatment groups have an equal(ish) average SAT score?

      "Student_07 Make transitions more fluid. Do not read off of powerpoint, it is better to have notecards if you do not know the information.

I'd also suggest making your text much bigger; it's a little difficult to read. Also, have you considered gender as a potential confounding variable? I'm not sure if gender affects how much sleep people get but it's a possibility. Also, level of intelligence could cause confounding. Maybe the athlete who doesn't have morning practices is just inherently more intelligent than the athlete with morning practices, so this could affect your results. Also, aren't the morning and non-morning practice sports different sports? I'm not sure you can attribute morning practices to \"athletic success\" if the sports are completely different.   \n",

      "Student_07 Consider other variables, some sports attract smarter people/require less time/have different intensity levels. You could isolate variables by measuring performance between the same sports with and without morning practices. Ex: how do High School X's XC runners (W/morning practice) compare to High School Y's XC runners (W/out morning practice)? Or how does performance compare between the 2021 season (w/ morning practice) and the 2022 season (w/out morning practice)?\n",

Also, I know you're using a random sample, but how do you have any guarantee that these students who are randomly selected will decide to participate? You may not get as many respondents as you hope by doing a random cluster sample since participation ultimately has to be voluntary.

Things in the beginning like the mentioning of homeless people could have been avoided since they did not directly relate to your question.

Maybe make them a bit bigger (you commented that one of them was difficult to read). I would explain your gap BEFORE you state your research question because it makes sense that you would have found your gap first before deciding on a question. Make the text much bigger on the Monetary Issues slide (you don't need the large color block for the title; it takes away space from the text). Your text is also impossible to read on the first Method and Instruments slide - maybe cut some text out and increase the font size. Using bullet points instead of complete sentences would also make it more digestible for the audience. Also, your question just says \"Later in Student Athletes.\" Do you mean later in their lives? And how do you define later? 10 years? Definitely specify this. \n",
